This is my first version of my first ever code/APP that I made with 10 hours of learning Python with Pycharm.

I will love to be a coder and learn more. 

This APP do:

1. Show live pictures extracted form a website.
2. Have different picture selector. (Live pictures)
3. Give refresh time option and refresh button.
4. Zoom in/out

To be honest my problem was to make sure the picture don't affect the down widget but I have difficulty doing it I will upload version 2.0 so it is 100% perfect at all time.

But I liked that it gave more place to see the picture due to zoom in/out option.

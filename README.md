This is the first version of my inaugural application, which I developed after dedicating 10 hours to learning Python with PyCharm.

I aspire to become a proficient coder and am eager to expand my knowledge.

This application has the following features:

- Displays live images extracted from a website.
- Includes a selector for different live images.
- Provides an option to set a refresh time and a refresh button.
- Allows for zooming in and out.

To be honest, I encountered a challenge ensuring that the image does not affect the widget below it. I had some difficulty resolving this, but I plan to address it in version 2.0 to ensure the application is flawless at all times.

One aspect I appreciated was that the zoom in/out feature provided more space to view the image.
